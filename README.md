Unity SpaceInvaders-like game
=============================

## Gameplay
Control player to defeat all invaders, avoid their shots.
Bases have different destruction model, which is based on random damage. Also middle-row aliens sometimes will be aiming at you, and the top-row aliens are kind of smart: they will almost in all cases aim at you

## Controls
  * AD - move player left\right
  * Space - shoot
  * Esc - exit game

## Known bugs
Sometimes when pause happens (you die, you cleared level, you ran out of lives) invaders won't stop and continue to move and shoot
